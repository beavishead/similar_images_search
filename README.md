# Image Similarity Search

An AI-powered application that finds similar images using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project implements an image similarity search using a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model. It allows users to upload an image and find visually similar images from a pre-defined dataset.

## Key Features

- Utilizes a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for feature extraction
- Pre-extracted features for quick similarity comparisons
- Flask web application for easy interaction
- Supports various image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- Flask
- Transformers library
- Git LFS for managing large files

## Setup and Installation

[Include instructions on how to set up and run the project locally]

## Usage

[Provide brief instructions on how to use the application]
